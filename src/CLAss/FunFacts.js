                    <h1>Here Are Some Functs::</h1>
                    <p>1. There is enough DNA in the average person’s body to stretch from the sun to Pluto and back — 17 times.</p>
                    <p>2. The average human body carries ten times more bacterial cells than human cells.</p>
                    <p>3. It takes a photon up to 40,000 years to travel from the core of the sun to its surface, but only 8 minutes to travel the rest of the way to Earth.</p>
                   <p>4. At over 2,000 kilometres long, The Great Barrier Reef is the largest living structure on Earth.</p>
                   <p>5. There are 8 times as many atoms in a teaspoonful of water as there are teaspoonfuls of water in the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
                   <p>6. In an entire lifetime, the average person walks the equivalent of five times around the world.</p>
                   <p>7. Killer whales are actually dolphins.</p>
                   <p>8. Grasshoppers have ears in their bellies.</p>
                   <p>9.  When Helium is cooled to almost absolute zero (-460°F or -273°C, the lowest temperature possible), it becomes a liquid with surprising properties: it flows against gravity and will start running up and over the lip of a glass container!</p>
                   <p>10. If Betelgeuse exploded, transitioning from the red supergiant stage to supernova, it would light our sky continuously for two months. It could happen anytime — within a couple of thousand years, tomorrow or even now</p>
                   <p>11. Octopuses have three hearts, nine brains, and blue blood. </p>
                   <p>12. The known universe is made up of 50,000,000,000 galaxies.</p>
                   <p>13. The Earth appears to have a whole new underground continent called Zealandia.</p>
                   <p>14. Before the 17th century, science and scientists were not truly recognized. At first, people like the 17th century genius Isaac Newton were called natural philosophers, because there was no concept of the word "scientist" at the time.</p>
                   <p>15. The only letter that doesn't appear on the periodic table is J.</p>
                   <p>16. An ice cube takes up about 9 percent more volume than the water used to make it. </p>
                   <p>17. A lightning strike can reach a temperature of 30,000 C or 54,000 F.</p>
                   <p>18. On Mars, iron oxide forms a rust dust that floats in the atmosphere and creates a coating across much of the landscape. </p>
                   <p>19. Every human being has 99 percent of their DNA in common. A parent and child share 99.5 percent of the same DNA, and you have 98 percent of your DNA in common with a chimpanzee.</p>
                   <p>20. The Queen Alexandra’s Birdwing is the world’s largest butterfly, with a wingspan of up to 12 inches. It is found only in Papua New Guinea and is considered endangered.</p>
                   <p>21. On each side of the first abdominal segment of a grasshopper, tucked under the wings, you'll find membranes that vibrate in response to sound waves. This simple eardrum, called a tympana, allows the grasshopper to hear the mating songs of members of their species.</p>
                   <p>22. Over the next 5 billion years or so, the sun will grow steadily brighter as the hydrogen at its core gets used up, creating increased internal pressure and thus increased fuel conversion to helium. In 1.1 billion years, the planet could start to look like Venus. Eventually, the Sun will run out of hydrogen fuel and collapse. </p>
                   <p>23. It is possible to die from drinking too much water. Water intoxication and hyponatremia result when a dehydrated person drinks too much water without the accompanying electrolytes. </p>
                   <p>24. Humans can only see about 5 percent of the matter in the universe. The rest is made up of invisible matter (called dark matter) and a mysterious form of energy known as dark energy.</p>
                   <p>25. Women are usually just the carriers of the genetic mutation for colour-blindness, which is passed on through the X chromosome. It is mostly men who inherit colour-blindness, affecting about 1 in 20 men for every 1 in 200 women.</p>
