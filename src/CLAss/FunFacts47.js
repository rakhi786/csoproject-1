                    <h1>Here Are Some Functs::</h1>
                    <p>1.Six elements account for 99 percent of the mass of the human body: oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus. The human body contains enough carbon for 9,000 pencils.</p>
                    <p>2.Scientists have estimated that about 95 percent of all the cells in the body are bacteria. The vast majority of these microbes can be found within the digestive tract. </p>
                    <p>3.Stegosaurus was equipped with an unusually small brain, about the size of a lime, comparable to that of a modern golden retriever. Carnivorous dinosaurs' brains were bigger than those of leaf-eaters, as they needed more grey matter to hunt mobile prey.</p>
                    <p>4.Bats are the world's only group of mammals that have wings. Although some other groups of mammals are able to glide using skin membranes, only bats are capable of true flight.</p>
                    <p>5.Penguins' eyes work better underwater than in the air. This perk gives them superior eyesight to spot prey while hunting, even in cloudy, dark, or murky water.</p>
                    <p>6.Bananas contain high levels of potassium and thus are slightly radioactive. It's not something you need to worry about, because 0.01 percent of the potassium already in your body is the same radioactive type (K-40). Potassium is essential for proper nutrition.</p>
                    <p>7.The longest cells in the human body are the motor neurons. They can be up to 4.5 feet long and run from the lower spinal cord to the big toe.</p>
                    <p>8.The blue whale can produce sounds up to 188 decibels, which is the loudest sound produced by a living animal and has been detected as far away as 530 miles.</p>
                    <p>9.The largest man-made lake in the U.S. is Lake Mead, created by the Hoover Dam.</p>
                    <p>10.The human eye blinks an average of 4.2 million times a year.</p>
                    <p>11.Armadillos, opossum and sloths spend about 80 percent of their lives sleeping.</p>
                    <p>12.The common goldfish is the only animal that can see both infrared and ultraviolet light.</p>
                    <p>13.Ants cannot chew their food. They move their jaws sideways, like scissors, to extract the juices from the food.</p>
                    <p>14.Hummingbirds are the only animals able to fly backward.</p>
                    <p>15.A crocodile’s tongue is attached to the roof of its mouth.</p>
                    <p>16.We know more about the surface of Mars and the Moon than we do about the bottom of our oceans</p>
                    <p>17.Boeing’s micro lattice is the lightest metal ever made. It is 99.9% air but still retains structure. </p>
                    <p>18.The speed of an incoming brain impulse is about 400 km/h.</p>
                    <p>19.Over the course of just one day, our blood 'runs' the distance of 19,312 kilometres.</p>
                    <p>20.A human eye can distinguish up to 10 million different colours. But it’s our brain that can't remember all of them.</p>
                    <p>21.The average person consumes about 35 tons of food during his or her life.</p>
                    <p>22.100,000 chemical reactions occur every second in our brains</p>
                    <p>23.Marie Curie was the first person to win two Nobel Prizes for Science (one in Physics and one in Chemistry).</p>
                    <p>24.The circumference of the earth is about 25,000 miles. Its surface area is about 200,000,000 square miles and it weighs 6,588,000,000,000,000,000,000 tons.</p>
                    <p>25.A diamond does not dissolve in acid. The only thing that can destroy it is intense heat</p>
