						<h2>Practice NEET sample papers and previous years’ question papers</h2>

			 <p>One of the greatest challenges for any entrance exam is the time limitation. Practise is key, not only for NEET, but any competitive exam.

Candidates should practice NEET sample papers and previous years’ question papers to improve their accuracy and speed levels. Solving question papers will also give them an idea about the question pattern, difficulty level of questions and chapter-wise weightage in the exam. They can also analyse their weak and strong areas by solving mock papers. Here is a list of Question papers from previous years:</p>
             	<ul class="limedical"><li><a href="#">NEET 2020 Question Paper with Answer Keys</a></li>
                 <li><a href="">NEET 2019 Question Paper with Answer Keys</a></li></ul>

						<h2>Concentrate on weaker sections</h2>
					</header>
			 <p>A student can be very strong in one topic and relatively weaker in another, but they should not get demotivated with this. They should work harder on the sections they are weak to strengthen them. They can take guidance from teachers and friends if they find it difficult to understand any concept. Candidates can solve NEET sample papers and previous year’s question papers to analyze their weaker areas and dedicate more time to those sections. By this, they can overcome their fear of weakness and gain a lot of confidence.</p>

						<h2>Take Scheduled Breaks</h2>
					</header>
			    <p>Candidates should avoid marathon study sessions, especially for difficult topics. While doing a challenging crossword, they may realize that if they take a break and come back to the puzzle, they will end up with a solution faster. This is because although students aren’t consciously solving it, their brain is still working in the background subconsciously. It does most of the hard work for them. Candidates should plan and take timed breaks in between study sessions to prepare for the exam in a better way.</p>

						<h2>Take care of health</h2>

			    <p>A complete sleep is the best meditation. Not only a healthy sleep will revitalize a student, but it also boosts their concentration power. They should make sure they take enough breaks (scheduled and not random) and maintain a regular sleep cycle. Since an aspirant’s brain does most of the hard work here, they should give it sufficient time to recuperate. Sufficient rest can also help candidates to stay positive and continue to remain motivated.</p>
             	<p>These are some NEET preparation tips that candidates can follow to score good marks in the exam. Apart from all these preparation tips and strategies, candidates still make some mistakes while preparing that can be harmful to their results.</p>
