						<h2>Academics</h2>
					<p>Academic is used to describe things that relate to the work done in schools, colleges, and universities, especially work that involves studying and reasoning rather than practical or technical skills. Academic achievement and excellence are considered important segments in every student’s life. Even though it is given importance at all the various hierarchical divisions that have been established by our education system, the weightage given to academics during 8th-10th is of greater importance and dominance keeping in mind further career opportunities.</p>

				 <p>During this phase (i.e. 13yrs-15yrs), every student struggle to find the perfect balance between the academic portion, and the co-curricular and extra-curricular portion. In order to ensure a smooth yet enthralling ride on this rollercoaster, that joins the two ends of excellence in academics and enjoyment of the teenage years, we present some tips and tricks (that are tested and verified by experts) for our users.</p>

                    <li><p><strong>1. </strong>Review all new information you’ve learned on the same day: This daily review will not take too long to complete, but it’s a vital step that ensures that information is moved to your long-term memory more quickly.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>2. </strong>Write everything down: To achieve the individual expectations, this is considered a pro tip. It might seem a little tedious and time-consuming in the beginning but in the long run it is a very helpful habit. </p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>3. </strong>Create weekly schedules: Chalk out a rough weekly schedule on the prior weekend. This will prepare you mentally and help you plan further activities of the week. This will also inculcate the habit of pre planning and executing things which will be very beneficial in the future.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>4. </strong> Set high yet achievable goals: Setting non-achievable and extremely high goals only give rise to negative stress and pressure, which results in low self-confidence; on the contrary setting achievable goals helps gain self-confidence and motivates to keep trying further.</p></li> 
                    <li><p><strong>5. </strong>Get at least 8 hours of sleep: Scientific researches show that students indulging in   8-9 hours of sleep are more productive and better at concentrating and focussing on studies for longer periods of time.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>6. </strong>Break bigger tasks into smaller tasks: We need to creatively manipulate our brain into thinking that we have less work to do. It is tested and verified that breaking tasks into smaller bits keeps the creativity and productivity of the student high and consistent.</p></li>
